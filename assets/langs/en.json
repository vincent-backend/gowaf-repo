From the perspective of a website owner, other than providing a much better experience for the end user, a CDN also helps to reduce the overall cost of delivering content.</p><br/><p>For very popular websites, bandwidth on the origin server is a major expense. The origin server does not consume as much bandwidth since most of the content served to its end users uses the bandwidth of the edge servers. This reduces the cost of bandwidth on the origin server, which uses a much smaller amount of bandwidth to serve content to the edge servers (usually a single time). Therefore, by using a CDN, a popular website can serve the same number of users at a lower cost.</p>",

This server is also called the origin server, because all the content of a website originates from this server. Without a CDN, all the content of a website will be served out of the origin server regardless of whether the request comes from a web browser in China, Italy, or Brazil.</p><br/><p>The website experience of different end users differs depending on their location. For example, if the origin server of a website is located in Rome, Italian web users will experience decreased latency and faster web page loading times. Users in China and Brazil will experience high latency and slower web page loading because data has to be transmitted over a much longer distance.</p><br/><p><img src=\\'/images/resources/WhatIsCDN/help_with@2x.png\\' /></p><br/><p>This is roughly how CDNs work -- data is physically closer to end-users, much like a warehouse of products. This results in faster delivery times - or in the case of CDNs, faster page load times. There is a caveat: most CDNs do not have a \"facility\" - or edge server - in the same city as every user. So, users will have usually have to contend with data within a close proximity, but the general experience for users should still be improved.</p>",
