Now, the Hamburg-based developer is a heavy hitter in the online gaming world, crafting award-winning free-to-play titles for gamers around the globe. They’re best known for titles like Tribal Wars, Elvenar, and Forge of Empires - the last of which grossed over 1 billion EUR in lifetime revenue.",

This amounted to over 500 terabytes per month of bandwidth.",

Once they started using Gowaf, they saw improvements right away. We didn’t require InnoGames to commit to a certain bandwidth just to get a fair price. We set them up with a pricing and bandwidth plan that fit their needs right out the gate.",
          "content2": "Finally, we gave them 24/7 access to our Super Gowaf support and set up a private Slack channel. InnoGames was already using Slack, so they loved the convenience.

However, the delivery speeds for users in Australia, East Asia, and South America were subpar, for which they routinely received complaints.",
          "content2": "Nexus Mods tried working with other CDN solutions, but the pricing model wasn’t realistic. Their last provider employed a 95th percentile pricing model that caused significant overage bills due to weekend traffic spikes. Nexus Mods wanted to maintain its status as a cost-conscious, community-based, and community-funded website. On top of this, their traffic requirements were too high for standard pricing but not high enough for enterprise pricing.",

          "content": "To help Nexus Mods solve these challenges, we worked together to find a solution that offered excellent performance while adhering to a very tight budget. The most significant factor behind their performance issues was a low cache hit rate. With their massive library of mods, their old CDN struggled to keep files in cache. It had to pull files from cold storage halfway across the world.",
          "content2": "We helped Nexus Mods migrate their 50 TB content library to our Edge Storage platform as a drop-in replacement. Edge Storage let them seamlessly replicate their files to 5 regions worldwide, guaranteeing consistent excellent performance. Next, we designed a custom CDN plan optimized for the best global efficiency and affordable pricing. We were able to offer significantly reduced pricing compared to their own CDN.",
